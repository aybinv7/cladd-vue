/**
 * Resolves a component's effective props, upstream's precedence:
 *
 * > explicit prop → `UiProvider`'s `defaults[componentName]` → the component's built-in default
 *
 * A prop passed explicitly as `undefined` still falls back to the default — important so wrapper
 * components forwarding `:prop="prop"` don't clobber app-wide defaults.
 *
 * Vue's `withDefaults` cannot express this on its own: it fills built-ins before anything can tell
 * "not passed" from "passed the default value". So components declare every prop with an explicit
 * `undefined` default (which also suppresses Vue's absent-boolean casting) and hand their built-ins
 * to this helper instead.
